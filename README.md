# CSCI 202 - Computer Organization II - Simple MIPS Simulator #

Part 1 of this project implements a basic single-cycle processor simulator for a reduced MIPS instruction set. Part 2 extends this single cycle implementation to simulate a processor with L1 instruction cache (L1-i$) and L1 data cache(L1-d$). 

## Features: ##
  + The single-cycle processor is implemented using the classical 5-stages ”fetch, decode, execute, memory, writeback” with only one instruction going through the stages at a time.
  + The caching is enabled or disabled by the macroprocessor ENABLE_L1_CACHES. This can be done by commenting out #define ENABLE_L1_CACHES in ```cpu.h``` on Line 13. When it is disabled, the simulator proceeds as a regular single-cycle processor. 
  + Configuration of the cache is as follows: the address space is 32-bits,2 KiB for each L1-i$ and L1-d$, Block size of 4 words, L1-i$ is direct-mapped, and L1-d$ is 4-way set associative with True LRU replacement policy using writeback policy for write hits and write-allocate for write misses.
  + The instructions that the simulator supports are: add, addi, and, andi, beq, bne, j, jal, jr, lui, lw, nor, or, ori, slt, slti, sll, srl, sw, sub, sra, xor, xori, syscall 	

## Requirements: ##
  + A C compiler is required to run this program. 
  + 2 text files are required, one containing the text segment of the instructions and one containing the data segment of the instructions in hexadecimal are generated using QtSpim. 
  + The text files are later converted to a binary file using create-prog.
  + The simulator takes the binary file as a command line argument.
  + If you don't have the Linux OS, you will be required to have the Linux sub-system installed on your system to run the program from the command line.

# Instructions: ##

## Making a new test case ##

#### QtSpim: ####
  + Open QtSpim
  + Load the asm code for the instruction being tested
  + Run the program
  + Copy the user text and user data segments to a text editor and save as text.txt and data.txt respectively
  + **Note: You must reinitialize and load the file before running the program again.**

#### Text.txt: ####
  + Example line: [00400000] 8fa40000  lw $4, 0($29)            ; 183: lw $a0 0($sp) # argc 
  + Only keep the hexadecimal 8fa40000
  + Do this for all the lines
  + Replace the first 5 hexadecimal with 00000000
  + Make sure there is a new line after the last hexadecimal

#### Data.txt ####
  + Example line: [10010000] 6c617473 676e696c 726f7720 2164656b  s t a l l i n g   w o r k e d ! 
  + Only keep the hexadecimals -- 6c617473 676e696c 726f7720 2164656b
  + Place each hexadecimal on a new line in the same order
  + Do the same for all the lines while making sure there are no whitespaces following each hexadecimal
  + Make sure there is a new line after the last hexadecimal
  + If there are no such lines, a simple 00000000 and a new line will suffice
  
#### Creating input file for simulator: ####
  + Compile the text and data files to form a binary file
  + Be in the directory of the text and data files of the test case
  + The create-prog file required to compile the text and data files into a binary file is under util directory
  + Hence, the command ```./../util/create-prog data.txt text.txt test_file.sim``` is used

## Running a test case ##

#### Compiling the Simulator: ####
  + If on Linux based system run ```make``` in the main directory.
  + If on Mac based system run ```clang -x c *.c *.h -o single-cycle-with-cache``` in the main directory.

  
#### Running the test files: ####
  + Be in the directory of the simulator binary file, ```single-cycle-with-cache```
  + (Assuming name of test case directory is hw3)
  + Use command -- ```./single-cycle-with-cache test_cases/hw3/hw3.sim``` 

# Test Cases: #
## Details of test case CPU STATS: ##
  + Stalls are counted as useless instructions
  + nop is used to mean 0x00000000 that was either included by the programmer or from the QTSpim conversion and is counted as a useful instruction
  + Cache misses incur 4 stall cycles.

### Name of test case: bne ###
### Purpose of test case: bne ###
To test if the bne instructions work.
Will branch and continue to loop as long as $t0 != $t1, which has the value of 25.
If successful, the program will end with register $t0 holding 25.
### ASM code of test case: bne ###
```
.data
.text
main:
	addi $t0, $0, 5
	addi $t1, $0, 25     
	loop:
		addi $t0, $t0, 5
		addi $t3, $0, 200
		bne $t0, $t1, loop		
	jr $ra
